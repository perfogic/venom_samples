  // Also, we will use Upgradable version of tip3 token.
  // It makes sense to use upgradable version of token even if you don't want
  // to upgrade token contract in the future. You can just send ownership
  // of the root to the black hole if you do not want to upgrade the token or
  // have ability to mint additional tokens.

  // There are three options for deploying a TokenRoot
  // The first one is a simple deployment with an external message.
  // So we will just set a temporarily pubkey to it, to be sure the contract's
  // constructor is called correctly.
  // ( The message which one called the constructor is
  // signed by owner of static variable - pubkey ).

  // The second one is deploying by an internal message with stateInit,
  // like we deployed in the simple-tip3 example. From the
  // address which one is set as a owner of the TokenRoot.

  // And the third one is using a special "deployer" contract.
  // It is like fabric for contracts to support deployment for wallets
  // which ones are not supported stateInit sending or other contracts
  // like dao. It is easier to deploy a token root by just
  // calling " the deploy method" of some contract rather to build an stateInit.
